Revision History
----------------

2.2.2 - Released 6/1/2010

Reduced memory usage.  Changed method to avoid DTD lookups that uses less memory.

2.2.1 - Released 2/12/2010

Enhanced the playlist name filter to include characters from the Latin 1 Supplement Block.

Replaced ad-hoc URL decoding of file paths with URLDecode class.  Now non-ASCII
characters are handled correctly in file names.

Added 'addIndex' logic.  Now uses incrementing index instead of iTunes Song Index.
Index is in the order iTunes has the songs in for each playlist.

2.2.0 - Released 01/19/2010

Added option to exclude 'Built In' playlists, including Music, Library, Genius, Movies, etc.

Fixed issue where spaces were being converted to underscores in playlist names.

Fixed issue with 'included file types'.  Only the M3UExt playlist type was correctly filtering
the file types.  Now all formats are.

Fixed issue with XML validation.  This version no longer attempts to validate the XML
file (required downloading DTD from apple).

2.1.1 - Released 12/7/2009

Changed logic for including 'MP3' files to use file extension instead of 'Type'.  iTunes uses
different values for 'Type' based on the local language.

Updated processing of Playlist Name.  All characters are replaced with an underscore (_) 
except A-Z,a-z,0-9,.[]{}-$=.  This should resolve any issues with playlists containing 
illegal characters.  This may result in some characters in non-western character sets 
to be replaced with _.  GUI and Console versions now contain the exact same logic.

2.1 - Released 11/25/2009

Added option to override default path separator character.  Options are Win (\) or Mac (/)

iTunes 9 changed the directory structure of the music folder.  Added logic to include 
the 'Music' subfolder as part of the Music Path, and therefore exclude it from the 
iTunes Structure file copy.

Updated Scala to version 2.7.7

2.0 - Released 11/3/2009

Promoted to the main iTunesExport project and updated version number to match.

Added (undocumented) includeUTFBOM feature.  Not sure it is correct.

Added support of .m3u8 extensions.

Added support to filter disabled tracks and by track file type (mp3, m4a, etc).

Improved console help display (support -? and -h).

Added ability to specify playlists to include or exclude from import.

Added copy functionality, with PLAYLIST, ITUNES, and FLAT modes.

0.2 - Released 2009-05-09
